## Development

### Requirements

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- `make` (optional, but recommended for the project’s preflight gate)

### Common commands

- Format: `make fmt`
- Lint: `make clippy`
- Test: `make test`
- LOC cap: `make loc-check` (must pass; Rust files must stay under 700 code LOC)
- Preflight (integration gate): `make preflight`

### Release metadata

- Root release version: `VERSION` (bare semver, currently aligned with `[workspace.package].version`)
- Root release notes: `CHANGELOG.md`

## Repository hygiene rules

This repo intentionally does not commit:

- Worktrees: `wt/`
- Build output: `target/`
- Download/extract scratch: `_download/`, `_extract/`
- Raw help captures: `cli_manifests/codex/raw_help/`
- Ad-hoc logs at repo root (for example `codex-stream.log`, `error.log`)

`make preflight` runs a repo hygiene check to prevent accidentally committing these artifacts.

## Triads/worktrees (project management)

Feature work is planned as triads (code / test / integration) with checklists and prompts under the
feature directory in `docs/project_management/next/<feature>/`.

Conventions:
- Task worktrees live under `wt/<branch>` (in-repo).
- Do not edit `docs/project_management/**` from inside a worktree.

See `docs/project_management/task-triads-feature-setup-standard.md`.
