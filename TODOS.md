### Select The First Real Third CLI Agent And Prepare Its Onboarding Packet

**What:** Choose the first real third CLI agent target after phase 1 lands and create a bounded onboarding packet for adding it to the manifest, backend-crate, and UAA promotion pipeline.

**Why:** Phase 1 intentionally proves future-agent readiness with synthetic fixtures only; this follow-on task turns that architectural readiness into an actual new agent integration when the repo is ready for product expansion.

**Context:** The 2026-04-15 `/plan-eng-review` for CLI manifest support-matrix automation explicitly deferred real third-agent onboarding to keep phase 1 focused on semantics cleanup, neutral parity/support tooling, generated support-matrix publication, and validator hardening. The next step after phase 1 is to pick one concrete CLI agent, document why it is the right target, define its manifest/root conventions, identify any upstream-specific seams that the new neutral modules still do not cover, and produce the implementation packet for snapshot, union, wrapper coverage, validation, backend-crate support, and UAA promotion decisions.

**Effort:** M
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Phase 1 support-matrix and neutral parity tooling landing cleanly
