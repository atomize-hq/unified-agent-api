# CI Checkpoint Plan — Unified Agent API

Status: Draft  
Date (UTC): 2026-02-16  
Feature directory: `docs/project_management/next/unified-agent-api/`

## Purpose

This plan defines the bounded CI checkpoints for the Unified Agent API feature so we do not run
redundant multi-OS CI on every triad while still getting deterministic cross-platform signal at
code-grounded seams.

Constraint (repo-specific):
- This repo must rely on **GitHub-hosted runners only** (no self-hosted behavior smoke gates).
- The CP1 checkpoint is implemented by a dedicated workflow created in C0:
  - `.github/workflows/unified-agent-api-smoke.yml`

## Checkpoint boundaries (code-grounded)

Current slice set (per ADR 0009 + `spec_manifest.md`):
- `C0`: core `agent_api` crate (types/traits/gateway/capabilities/events; no real backends)
- `C1`: Codex backend adapter (feature-gated)
- `C2`: Claude Code backend adapter (feature-gated)

Boundary choice:
- A single checkpoint after `C2` is within the default bounds (`min=2`, `max=4`) and ensures the
  cross-platform signal validates the *complete* end-to-end universal surface (core + both backends).

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Required `tasks.json` wiring (deterministic)

When authoring `docs/project_management/next/unified-agent-api/tasks.json`:

- Create an ops/integration-style task id: `CP1-ci-checkpoint`.
- Set `depends_on: ["C2-integ"]`.
- If future slices are added after `C2`, the first task of the next slice MUST depend on
  `CP1-ci-checkpoint` so no work proceeds past the checkpoint without the gate.

## Notes / constraints

- No self-hosted behavior smoke gates are planned; all gates must run on GitHub-hosted runners.
- If any slice introduces platform-specific behavior (PTY, path handling, env precedence), we may
  split into two checkpoints (e.g., `C0+C1` and `C2`) with explicit justification and updated JSON.
