### S2 - ADR + pack sync and gate publication

- **User/system value**: turns the SEAM-1 verification pass into a downstream-citable published reference (commit/PR), preventing implementation seams from relying on an unpublishable local HEAD note.
- **Scope (in/out)**:
  - In:
    - sync ADR-0020 and pack restatements to canonical specs after S1 completes
    - update the SEAM-1 verification record to cite a commit/PR reference
  - Out:
    - any new canonical design decisions (must be made in canonical specs first)
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - SEAM-1 verification record no longer uses a provisional local HEAD reference
  - downstream seams can cite a stable reference without ambiguity
- **Dependencies**: S1
- **Verification**: updated verification record entry is unambiguous and points at a published ref.
- **Rollout/safety**: treat an unpublishable local HEAD reference as a blocker for downstream mergeability.

#### S2.T1 - Sync non-normative restatements after canonical truth is confirmed

- **Outcome**: ADR + pack text matches canonical specs.
- **Thread/contract refs**: `THR-01`

#### S2.T2 - Publish the verification record reference (commit/PR)

- **Outcome**: verification record cites a commit hash or PR URL and is usable by downstream seams.
- **Thread/contract refs**: `THR-01`
