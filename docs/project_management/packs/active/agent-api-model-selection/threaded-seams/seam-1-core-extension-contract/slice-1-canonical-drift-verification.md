### S1 - Canonical drift verification (C-01..C-04)

- **User/system value**: ensures downstream seams implement against one canonical truth and do not inherit ambiguous or contradictory doc guidance.
- **Scope (in/out)**:
  - In:
    - compare canonical owner spec + registry entry + inherited run lifecycle/error baselines
    - detect any mismatch against ADR/pack restatements
    - if mismatch exists, update canonical specs first, then sync ADR + pack
  - Out:
    - backend code changes
- **Acceptance criteria**:
  - mismatch-free alignment across the compared sources for v1 semantics (trim/bounds/absence, invalid template, runtime rejection posture)
  - any drift is resolved with canonical-first edits
- **Dependencies**: none
- **Verification**:
  - record a repeatable comparison scope (files + headings)
  - append a pass/fail entry under `../../seam-1-core-extension-contract.md`
- **Rollout/safety**: treat unresolved drift as blocking for SEAM-2 and beyond.

#### S1.T1 - Run and record the drift comparison

- **Outcome**: a clear pass/fail result plus the exact compared sources list.
- **Thread/contract refs**: `THR-01`, `C-01..C-04`
- **Acceptance criteria**: record includes date, verifier, compared sources, and pass/fail.

Checklist:
- Validate: compared sources list matches the seam brief
- Validate: result is recorded under the pack seam brief (`../../seam-1-core-extension-contract.md`)
