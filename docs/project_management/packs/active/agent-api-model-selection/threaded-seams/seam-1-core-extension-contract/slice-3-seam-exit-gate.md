### S3 - Seam-exit gate (SEAM-1)

This is the dedicated final seam-exit slice for SEAM-1. It does not hide unfinished feature delivery work.

- **Purpose**: record the canonical truth and the published verification reference that downstream seams must cite.
- **Planned landed evidence**:
  - link to commit/PR that contains any canonical doc edits (if needed)
  - link to commit/PR that syncs ADR + pack restatements
  - SEAM-1 verification record entry citing the published reference
- **Contracts expected to publish or change**: `C-01`, `C-02`, `C-03`, `C-04`
- **Threads expected to advance**: `THR-01`
- **Downstream stale triggers**:
  - any later canonical doc delta for v1 semantics requires re-running and re-publishing the verification record
- **Promotion readiness statement**:
  - downstream promotion is blocked unless SEAM-1 closeout records `seam_exit_gate.status: passed` and `promotion_readiness: ready`

Checklist:
- Validate: closeout file updated: `../../governance/seam-1-closeout.md`
- Validate: remediation log updated if needed: `../../governance/remediation-log.md`
