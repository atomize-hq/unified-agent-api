# SEAM-3 - Codex backend mapping (Activated)

## Seam brief (source of truth)

- See `../../seam-3-codex-mapping.md`.

## Promotion basis

- Upstream seam exit: `../../governance/seam-2-closeout.md` (seam-exit gate passed; promotion readiness ready).
- Required threads: `THR-01`, `THR-02` are published per `../../threading.md`.

## Next planning step

- Execute `slice-*.md` sequentially (S1..S4), then complete the dedicated `seam-exit-gate` slice.
