## Issues

### CX-0001 — Drop semantics wording conflicts on “cancel”
- Severity: major
- Confidence: medium
- Type: scope_mismatch
- Subject: ADR-0014: drop semantics vs cancellation meaning
- Scope: environment=all, version=unknown, feature_flag=none, timeline=planned
- Statement A: `docs/adr/0014-agent-api-explicit-cancellation.md:66-69` — “dropping must not imply cancel, but consumers still need a supported way to cancel intentionally.”
- Statement B: `docs/adr/0014-agent-api-explicit-cancellation.md:142-144` — “Drop semantics remain “best-effort cancellation”… not required to be reliable.”
- Why this conflicts: Within the same ADR, one statement reads as “dropping must not imply cancel”, while a later section states that drop semantics remain “best-effort cancellation” per the run protocol. These can both be true only if the earlier “cancel” refers specifically to explicit/intentional cancellation (not drop-based best-effort cancellation), but that scope qualifier is not stated, leading to incompatible reader interpretations.
- What must be true:
  - Whether dropping `events` / the run handle is specified as a cancellation signal (even best-effort) or only as a consumer opt-out, and how the term “cancel” is scoped in ADR-0014.
