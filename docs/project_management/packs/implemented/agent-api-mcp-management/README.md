# Universal MCP management commands (add/get/list/remove) — seam extraction (ADR-0018)

Source ADR: `docs/adr/0018-universal-mcp-management-commands.md`  
Canonical draft spec (normative once approved): `docs/specs/unified-agent-api/mcp-management-spec.md`  
Backlog: `uaa-0006` (`bucket=agent_api.tools`, `type=api_surface`)

This directory contains **seam** artifacts extracted to make the work owner-assignable and parallelizable without hiding coupling.
These files are planning aids; they are not normative contracts (authoritative contracts remain in `docs/specs/**`).

Note: The MCP management spec is currently **Draft**. This pack treats it as the canonical implementation target; changes
should be made in the spec (and any other canonical contracts) first, then reflected here.
