# Run Protocol Spec — Universal Agent API

Status: Approved  
Approved (UTC): 2026-02-21  
Date (UTC): 2026-02-16

This spec defines the lifecycle semantics for `agent_api` runs, event ordering, and completion.

This document is normative and uses RFC 2119 keywords (MUST/SHOULD/MUST NOT).

## Run lifecycle

1. Caller constructs `AgentWrapperRunRequest` and an `AgentWrapperKind`.
2. Caller invokes `AgentWrapperGateway::run(&agent_kind, request)`.
3. `AgentWrapperGateway` resolves an `AgentWrapperBackend` for the `AgentWrapperKind`, otherwise returns `AgentWrapperError::UnknownBackend`.
4. Backend validates required capabilities for the requested operation.
5. Backend starts a run and returns an `AgentWrapperRunHandle`:
   - an event stream
   - a completion result future/value

## Streaming vs buffered events (DR-0001)

- Live streaming is not guaranteed across all agents.
- Backends MUST advertise whether they support live streaming via capabilities.
- Capability meaning (normative):
  - If a backend includes `agent_api.events.live`, the backend MUST be able to emit at least one
    `AgentWrapperEvent` before the underlying process exits for non-trivial runs (i.e., events are not
    purely post-hoc).
  - If a backend does not include `agent_api.events.live`, the backend MAY buffer and emit events
    only post-hoc (after the underlying process exits).
- If a backend does not support live streaming:
  - it may buffer events and emit them post-hoc (after the underlying process exits)
  - it must still preserve event ordering relative to the buffered production

## Relationship between `completion` and the event stream (v1, normative)

- `AgentWrapperRunHandle.completion` MUST NOT resolve until:
  1) the underlying backend process has exited, and
  2) the event stream has emitted all buffered events (if any) and has terminated.

This ensures that when `completion` resolves, the consumer can treat the event stream as final
(no late-arriving events).

## Ordering guarantees

- Within a single `AgentWrapperRunHandle`, events are emitted in the order produced by the backend mapping.
- No cross-run ordering is implied.

## Cancellation semantics (minimum)

- Cancellation is best-effort:
  - Dropping `AgentWrapperRunHandle` (or dropping its `events` stream) is a best-effort cancellation
    signal; the backend MAY attempt to terminate the underlying process.
  - Consumers requiring deterministic cancellation MUST use the explicit cancellation handle
    (`run_control(...)`) when available.

## Explicit cancellation semantics (v1, normative)

When a caller uses `AgentWrapperGateway::run_control(...)`, the returned `AgentWrapperCancelHandle`
provides an explicit cancellation signal.

- Capability gating:
  - Backends MUST advertise `agent_api.control.cancel.v1` if and only if they support explicit
    cancellation.
  - If a backend does not advertise `agent_api.control.cancel.v1`, `run_control(...)` MUST fail-closed
    with `AgentWrapperError::UnsupportedCapability { capability: "agent_api.control.cancel.v1" }`.

- Calling `AgentWrapperCancelHandle::cancel()` MUST be idempotent.
- Backends MUST attempt best-effort termination of the underlying backend process when `cancel()`
  is invoked.
- If `cancel()` occurs before completion resolves successfully, `completion` MUST resolve to:
  - `Err(AgentWrapperError::Backend { message })` where `message == "cancelled"`.
- If `cancel()` is called after completion already resolved, cancellation is a no-op and MUST NOT
  change the resolved completion value.

## Capability validation timing

- Unsupported operations must fail-closed:
  - validate capabilities before spawning work where possible
  - if an operation becomes unsupported mid-run (backend error), complete with error and emit an `Error` event if feasible

Extension validation (v1, normative):
- Backends MUST validate `AgentWrapperRunRequest.extensions` keys and values before spawning any backend process.

## Required completion semantics (v1, normative)

- `AgentWrapperRunHandle.completion` MUST resolve exactly once.
- On success, `completion` MUST contain the underlying process `ExitStatus`.
- `AgentWrapperCompletion.final_text`:
  - MAY be populated when the backend can deterministically extract a “final” text response.
  - MUST be `None` if the backend cannot do so safely or deterministically.
