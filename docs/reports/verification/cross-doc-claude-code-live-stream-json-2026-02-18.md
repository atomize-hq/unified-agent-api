# Cross-Documentation Verification Report

**Target**: `docs/project_management/next/claude-code-live-stream-json/` (planning pack)  
**Date (UTC)**: 2026-02-18  
**Documents Checked**: 19 (planning pack docs + ADR/baselines)

## Executive Summary

The planning pack is internally consistent and aligns with ADR-0010 and the Unified Agent API specs, with all referenced artifacts present and cross-references resolving.

## Consistency Score: 100/100

- Conflicts: 0
- Gaps: 0
- Duplication: 0
- Drift: 0

## Conflicts (Must Resolve)

None.

## Gaps (Should Fill)

None.

## Duplication (Should Consolidate)

None.

## Drift (Consider Updating)

None.

## Positive Findings

- ✅ Planning-pack artifact set matches `spec_manifest.md` and all referenced file paths resolve (including workflow + smoke scripts).
- ✅ Decision Register decisions (backpressure, parse error policy, stderr handling, channel capacity, timeout/cancel) are consistently reflected across:
  - `contract.md`
  - `stream-json-print-protocol-spec.md`
  - `platform-parity-spec.md`
  - `C0-spec.md` / `C1-spec.md`
- ✅ Unified Agent API contract invariants are consistently referenced:
  - capability advertisement (`agent_api.events.live`)
  - completion gating vs event stream finality (Unified Agent API DR-0012)
  - raw backend line prohibition + envelope bounds
- ✅ CI checkpoint wiring is coherent across `ci_checkpoint_plan.md`, `tasks.json`, and `.github/workflows/claude-code-live-stream-json-smoke.yml`.

## Recommendations

1. Proceed to execution; no blocking cross-doc issues remain.
