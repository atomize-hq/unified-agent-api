# Scope brief

This automated maintenance lane is limited to the frozen shared packet for `codex` and the declared writable surfaces below.

## Support uplift rule

Newly discovered non-TUI surface must land in this run unless the frozen packet records one allowed deferral. Preexisting non-TUI gaps remain valid only when the packet ties them to the committed debt inventory.
