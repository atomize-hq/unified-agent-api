# Universal parity acquisition & promotion — generalization plan

**Date:** 2026-07-24
**Base revision:** `origin/staging` @ `9400ee8e`
**Author:** lead orchestration session, from a read-only investigation of the shipped
xtask parity/maintenance system. Every claim below cites a verified `file:line` or a
committed artifact; the workstream-A design was dug into against repo truth before this
plan was written.
**Status:** **Implementation complete; three acceptance criteria remain gated on maintainer-run
CI.** Branch `feat/parity-acquisition-generalization`, off `origin/staging` @ `9400ee8e`, 6
commits, nothing pushed. `make preflight` green; 431 tests passing. Both required review lanes ran
and every finding is adjudicated (§11 Opus, §14 Codex).

What still needs a human: proving the multi-OS matrix on real runners, reconciling the two stuck
packets, and any promotion. None can be done from a laptop — they need macOS/Windows/ARM runners
and a push. See §13 for the checklist.

## 1. Why this exists

The universal onboarding/maintenance **lifecycle** is agent-agnostic and works — `opencode`
proved it end-to-end through the generic packet-PR path
(`docs/agents/lifecycle/opencode-maintenance/governance/proof/workflow-dispatch-summary.md`:
*"resolved directly to the generic packet-PR opener … without introducing a bespoke
workflow surface"*).

What was **never generalized** is the **multi-target parity acquisition and promotion** —
the step that turns a detected upstream release into a *complete, validated, promotable*
manifest. It exists only as **per-agent workflow copies** (codex + claude) that drive
generic engines, and is **absent for opencode**. So the generic maintenance flow produces
a **single-host, partial-union, `status: reported`** packet for every agent, and promotion
cannot complete.

The same wall blocks both enrolled union-model agents that have been maintained:

| Agent | Target | `versions/<v>.json` status | Union | `latest_validated.txt` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| codex | `0.144.6` | `reported` | 2 of 4 (`complete:false`) | `0.125.0` |
| opencode | `1.14.47` | `reported` | 1 of 6 (`complete:false`) | `1.4.11` |

`opencode` is therefore **not** actually working end-to-end: it proved the generic
PR-creation + implementation path, then hit the identical promotion wall.

---

## 2. Current-state map (verified)

| Layer | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle orchestration (`maintenance-watch` → `agent-maintenance-open-pr` → `execute-agent-maintenance` → `refresh-agent` → `close-agent-maintenance` → `check-agent-drift`) | **Generic**, agnostic, opencode-proven | all keyed by `<agent_id>`; opencode proof above |
| Parity **engines** (`codex-union` / `codex-report` / `codex-validate` / `codex-version-metadata` / `codex-wrapper-coverage`) | **Already generic — only codex-*named*** | all take `--root` + read `<root>/RULES.json` (`codex_union.rs:22-25`, `codex_report.rs:16-20`, `codex_version_metadata.rs:21-25`); **opencode's own packet runs `codex-validate --root cli_manifests/opencode`** (`opencode-maintenance/HANDOFF.md`), claude's promote runs `codex-version-metadata --root cli_manifests/claude_code` (`claude-code-promote.yml:82-98`) |
| Release **watcher** | **Generic + hardened** | reads registry for all agents; fetch hardening (PRs #148/#151/#152) is agent-neutral, proven live on all 3 (`failed_agents:0`) |
| Multi-target **acquisition** | **Per-agent workflow copies; opencode absent; not wired into the flow** | `codex-cli-update-snapshot.yml` and `claude-code-update-snapshot.yml` are near-duplicates; no opencode equivalent; neither is called by `agent-maintenance-open-pr.yml` |
| **Promotion** (writes `latest_validated`, sets `status: validated`) | **Per-agent workflow copies; opencode absent** | `codex-cli-promote.yml:167-180`, `claude-code-promote.yml:76-97`; both are standalone `workflow_dispatch` |
| **Snapshot generation** (capture a CLI's surface) | **Per-CLI** | `codex-snapshot`, `claude-snapshot`; opencode's are hand-produced by the relay |

**Core insight:** the generic flow's executor runs on **one host**, so it can only snapshot
**one target** → a partial union → `reported`. Advancing to a complete-union `validated`
state needs multi-target acquisition + promotion, which today is disconnected legacy copies
(codex, claude) and missing (opencode). That single gap is the root of both stuck packets.

---

## 3. Design north star

One RULES-driven, agent-parameterized parity subsystem:

1. **Engines stay as-is** (already generic). Rename to neutral names with back-compat
   aliases — cosmetic, removes the codex-branding that has been causing confusion.
2. **One reusable acquisition workflow** + **one reusable promotion workflow**
   (`workflow_call`), parameterized by `agent_id`, that read a new per-agent **acquisition
   descriptor** to: build the target matrix → download each target's binary → snapshot each
   → union → report → validate → (promotion) advance pointers. Retire the 4 copies.
3. **Wired into the generic maintenance flow:** the watcher-opened packet PR triggers
   acquisition *in the runner* so the PR lands with the **complete** multi-target union (the
   full cross-platform detail to review); **promotion stays a maintainer-gated step**.

---

## 4. Workstream A — repo-truth findings (dug in for this plan)

The four workflows are **two near-duplicate pairs** driving the **same generic engines**.
The agent-specific delta is exactly **three data-only dimensions** (acquisition) plus **one**
(promotion):

| Dimension | codex | claude_code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| upstream metadata fetch | GitHub API `releases/tags/rust-v<ver>` (`codex-cli-update-snapshot.yml`) | **GCS** `…/claude-code-releases/<ver>/manifest.json` (`claude-code-update-snapshot.yml:74-77`) |
| per-target `{runner, asset_name, binary_path, extract}` | hardcoded `case` — 4 Rust triples incl. `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | hardcoded `case` — 3 targets, asset `claude`/`claude.exe` |
| version+target → download URL | `github.com/openai/codex/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>` | `<bucket>/<ver>/<target>/<asset>` |
| **(promote)** per-target validation command | full CODEX_E2E suite (`codex-cli-promote.yml:140-144`) | `cargo test -p unified-agent-api-claude-code` (`claude-code-promote.yml:69`) |

Everything else is structurally identical: compute matrix from
`RULES.json union.expected_targets`, download per target, build `artifacts.lock.json`, the
per-target snapshot job, and the `union → report → validate → version-metadata` job on the
generic engines.

**Two-source fact + decision (2026-07-24):** today watch-source ≠ acquisition-source for
`claude_code` — it **watches** npm `stable` (`registry: source_kind=npm_dist_tag`, migrated in
#148) but **acquires** binaries from the legacy **GCS bucket** (`.../claude-code-releases/<ver>/manifest.json`),
whose LIST 401s (the reason we moved *watch* to npm) even though object-GET still works.

**Decision: switch `claude_code` acquisition to npm too** (validated against the registry, not
assumed). npm carries the real per-platform binaries:
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.206` declares **8 platform `optionalDependencies`**
  (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code-{linux-x64,linux-x64-musl,linux-arm64,linux-arm64-musl,darwin-x64,darwin-arm64,win32-x64,win32-arm64}`).
- `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-linux-x64-musl` is a **267.8 MB** package (`os:[linux] cpu:[x64]`) — a
  real native binary, not a shim.
- The main package's `install.cjs` resolves the binary via `optionalDependencies` / `process.platform`
  with **no** `storage.googleapis` reference — the install path does not touch GCS.
- claude's committed target names (`linux-x64`, `darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`) already **map 1:1** onto
  the npm platform packages, so only the *download dimension* changes; targets/matrix/runners stay.

This unifies claude's watch + acquire on npm, retires the flaky GCS dependency, and reduces the
generic workflow to two acquisition `source_kind`s (github_releases + npm) rather than three. The
descriptor still models watch and acquire as **independent** fields (codex acquire stays
`github_releases`), but claude's both become npm. `opencode` almost certainly resolves the same way
(open decision #5).

**Descriptor home:** `RULES.json` has **no acquisition section today** — `union` holds only the
target model (`required_target`, `expected_targets`, `platform_mapping`, `partial_union_policy`,
`promotion_policy`). The per-target runner/asset/URL mapping lives **only** in the workflow
`case` blocks. Proposed: a new **`acquisition`** block in each agent's `RULES.json`, e.g.

```jsonc
"acquisition": {
  "source_kind": "github_releases",              // github_releases | gcs_bucket | npm
  "metadata": { "url_template": "https://api.github.com/repos/openai/codex/releases/tags/{tag}",
                "tag_template": "rust-v{version}" },
  "targets": {
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl": { "runs_on": "ubuntu-latest", "asset_name": "codex-{target}.tar.gz",
      "binary_path": "./codex-{target}", "extract": true,
      "url_template": "https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/download/{tag}/{asset}" }
    // … one entry per expected_target
  },
  "validation_commands": [ "cargo test -p unified-agent-api-codex", "…" ]
}
```

The reusable workflow reads this; **no per-agent YAML remains**. The `npm` variant (claude, and
likely opencode) sets `source_kind: "npm"` with a per-target `url_template` of
`https://registry.npmjs.org/{plat_pkg}/-/{plat_pkg_base}-{version}.tgz` where `plat_pkg` is the
platform package (e.g. `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-{target}`); the snapshot step extracts the binary
from that tarball and runs it on the matching-OS runner (native execution is still required to
capture the CLI surface, so the multi-OS matrix stays regardless of source).

---

## 5. Workstreams

### A. Unify acquisition + promotion into reusable workflows *(load-bearing)*

- **Objective:** one `.github/workflows/parity-acquire.yml` (`workflow_call`) + one
  `parity-promote.yml`, agent-parameterized from a `RULES.json` `acquisition` block. Retire
  the four copies.
- **Target design:** matrix from `union.expected_targets`; per-target download from
  `acquisition.targets[t].url_template`; snapshot via the agent's snapshot command (see C);
  union/report/validate/version-metadata via the generic engines with `--root cli_manifests/<agent>`;
  promotion writes `latest_validated` + per-target pointers + `version-metadata --status validated`
  and runs `acquisition.validation_commands`.
- **Write-set:** `.github/workflows/parity-acquire.yml` (new), `.github/workflows/parity-promote.yml`
  (new); `cli_manifests/{codex,claude_code,opencode}/RULES.json` (+`acquisition`);
  `cli_manifests/*/SCHEMA.json` (schema for the new block); deprecate/delete
  `{codex-cli,claude-code}-{update-snapshot,promote}.yml`; docs.
- **Acceptance:** dispatch `parity-acquire` for codex `0.145.0` → complete 4-target union
  committed; `parity-promote` → `latest_validated` advances; renamed validate is green.
  Same for claude; opencode acquires its declared target set.
- **Depends on:** nothing (engines exist). **Blocks:** B.
- **Risks:** acquisition-source auth (GCS object-GET, GH release); macOS/Windows/ARM runner
  cost; `source_kind` branching correctness.

### B. Wire acquisition + promotion into the generic maintenance flow

- **Objective:** the watcher-opened packet PR runs `parity-acquire` in the runner so the PR
  lands with the complete union; promotion stays a maintainer-gated `parity-promote` dispatch.
- **Current truth:** `agent-maintenance-open-pr.yml` runs only `prepare-agent-maintenance` +
  `refresh-agent` (docs); it never calls acquisition. The parity workflows are standalone.
- **Target:** `open-pr` (or the release-watch fan-out) invokes `parity-acquire.yml` against
  the packet branch for union-model agents, gated by a new per-agent registry field (e.g.
  `maintenance.parity_acquisition = "reusable"`); docs-only agents are unaffected (empty ⇒
  no acquisition, current behavior preserved).
- **Write-set:** `.github/workflows/agent-maintenance-open-pr.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/agent-maintenance-release-watch.yml` (if fan-out triggers it),
  `crates/xtask/data/agent_registry.toml` (+field), `docs/specs/agent-registry-contract.md`.
- **Acceptance:** a watcher run for a stale union-model agent opens a PR that fills in with a
  complete union; docs-only agents unchanged.
- **Depends on:** A.

### C. Snapshot-generation generalization *(the per-CLI piece)*

- **Objective:** a sanctioned snapshot adapter for every union-model agent. `codex-snapshot`
  and `claude-snapshot` exist; **opencode has none** (its snapshots are hand-produced by the
  autonomous relay — fragile). Decide: per-agent `*-snapshot` commands vs. a generic
  `agent-snapshot` with per-CLI adapter modules.
- **Write-set:** `crates/xtask/src/<agent>_snapshot*` (or a generic command + adapters);
  RULES/registry wiring so the reusable workflow selects the right snapshot command.
- **Depends on:** parallelizable with A/B; **required** for opencode acquisition to stop being
  manual.

### D. Support-tier gating + onboarding integration

- **Objective:** define the support tier at which an agent enters multi-target
  acquisition/promotion, and route the **same** reusable acquisition into onboarding so a new
  agent's baseline is captured consistently.
- **Current truth:** tiers `bootstrap → baseline_runtime → publication_backed → first_class`
  in `lifecycle-state.json`; the onboarding baseline snapshot comes from the single-host
  `runtime-follow-on`; no tier gate on acquisition exists.
- **Write-set:** onboarding/lifecycle tooling (`runtime-follow-on`, publication), registry,
  `docs/specs/cli-agent-onboarding-charter.md`, `docs/cli-agent-onboarding-factory-operator-guide.md`.
- **Depends on:** A (reusable acquisition must exist to be called from onboarding).

### E. Cleanup / consistency

- Rename `codex-*` engines → neutral (`manifest-union` / `manifest-report` / `manifest-validate` /
  `manifest-version-metadata`) with back-compat aliases (roadmap W6).
- Reconcile opencode `RULES.json` `union.expected_targets` (**3**: `linux-x64`, `darwin-arm64`,
  `win32-x64`) vs its committed `snapshots/1.14.47/union.json` `expected_targets` (**6**) drift;
  normalize opencode's thin `RULES.json` to the full schema (it lacks `automation`,
  `version_metadata`, `report`).
- Reconcile the two stuck packets (codex `0.144.6`, opencode `1.14.47`) through the new path.
- **Depends on:** after A/B land (rename touches workflow references).

---

## 6. Sequencing

```
A ──▶ B
C ── (parallel to A/B; gates opencode acquisition)
D ── (parallel; depends on A for the callable acquisition)
E ── (last; rename + reconciliation after A/B are green)
```

A is load-bearing and unblocks both stuck packets. B delivers the maintainer-facing flow.
C removes opencode's manual snapshot dependency. D generalizes the entry gate + onboarding.
E is cleanup that must follow the rename-sensitive work.

---

## 7. Execution protocol

Fresh branch off `origin/staging`. One bounded Codex implementation packet per workstream with
non-overlapping write sets; independent packets parallelized. Every material candidate gets a
parallel Codex + Opus read-only review lane, lead adjudication, and a lead final once-over with
`make preflight` before integration — the same protocol used for W1–W4.

**Standing constraint:** the repository's maintenance tooling owns release detection, target
selection, validation, and promotion. This campaign **builds the tooling**; it does not
hand-author any agent version upgrade. Nothing is pushed, merged, or promoted without the
maintainer.

---

## 8. Decisions (settled 2026-07-24; maintainer may override)

1. **Acquisition-descriptor home** — a new **`acquisition` block in each agent's
   `cli_manifests/<agent>/RULES.json`** (+ `SCHEMA.json`), co-located with the `union` target model.
2. **Snapshot generation (C)** — follow the existing **per-agent `*-snapshot` adapter** pattern (add
   `opencode-snapshot` mirroring `codex-snapshot`/`claude-snapshot`). A generic command + adapter
   modules is optional later cleanup, not required for done.
3. **Support-tier gate (D)** — enable multi-target acquisition for any agent that is **enrolled in
   `release_watch` and carries an `acquisition` block**. (Revisit if a stricter tier gate is wanted.)
4. **The two stuck packets** — reconcile `codex 0.144.6` / `opencode 1.14.47` **through the new
   path**; the actual promote stays maintainer-gated (prove readiness, don't self-promote).
5. **Acquisition sources — settled for all three agents:** `codex = github_releases`,
   `claude_code = npm`, `opencode = npm`. Validated against the npm registry (below). The registry's
   stale `opencode` entry (`github_releases`/`anomalyco`) is corrected to npm as part of E.

### Validation evidence (npm as binary source)

- **claude_code → npm**: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.206` declares 8 platform
  `optionalDependencies`; `@anthropic-ai/claude-code-linux-x64-musl` is a **267.8 MB** real binary;
  `install.cjs` resolves via `optionalDependencies`/`process.platform` with **no** `storage.googleapis`
  reference. claude target names map 1:1 to npm platform packages (only the download URL changes).
- **opencode → npm**: `opencode-ai@1.18.4` declares 12 platform `optionalDependencies`;
  `opencode-linux-x64` is a **178.9 MB** real binary. Naming nuance for E: opencode uses
  `opencode-windows-x64` (not `win32-x64`), so the descriptor's `url_template` maps target →
  platform-package name per agent.

---

## 9. Execution status

| Workstream | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A1** — generalize + rename the engines | **done** | `manifest-union` reproduces the committed codex `0.144.6` and claude `2.1.29` unions byte-for-byte; `claude_union` deleted |
| **A2** — `acquisition` descriptor + planner | **done** | `acquisition` block in all three `RULES.json`; `xtask manifest-acquisition-plan`; 12 contract tests; every resolved URL verified live against the GitHub and npm registries |
| **A3** — reusable workflows | **done** | `parity-acquire.yml` + `parity-promote.yml` added; the 4 per-agent copies deleted |
| **B** — wire acquisition into the generic flow | **done** | `agent-maintenance-open-pr.yml` calls `parity-acquire` on the packet branch with `commit: true` |
| **C** — `opencode-snapshot` adapter | **done** | yargs parser + 9 unit tests; verified against the real 1.18.4 binary (62 commands, no omissions) |
| **D** — support-tier gate + onboarding | **done** | gate enforced by `manifest_acquisition::plan_for_agent`; entry rule documented in the charter and the registry contract |
| **E** — drift + stuck packets | **done, except the maintainer-gated runs** | engine rename landed in A1; `claude_code` duplicate `scope` key removed; opencode `RULES.json` normalized to the full schema; win32→windows-x64 mapping verified live. Stuck-packet reconciliation needs CI runners — see §12 |

### What actually changed the shape of the system

The generic flow's executor runs on one host, so it could only ever produce a partial,
`complete:false` union. Three things now close that gap:

1. **One engine, not one per agent.** `union.tool_name` and `union.raw_help_layout` moved the
   only two agent-specific behaviors out of the union engine and into manifest data.
2. **One descriptor, not four workflows.** `acquisition` describes *how to obtain* a release for
   every expected target; `manifest-acquisition-plan` resolves it into a matrix.
3. **One lane, called from the flow.** The watcher-opened packet PR now runs the full
   cross-platform matrix in the runner and commits the complete union onto the packet branch.

## 10. Reconciliations against repo truth

These correct claims in §§1–8 that did not survive verification. Where this section and an
earlier section disagree, this section is authoritative.

1. **§2 / §3.1 — "engines are already generic, only codex-*named*" was not accurate.**
   `codex_union` hardcoded the `codex-cli` tool name, and a near-verbatim `claude_union` copy
   existed solely because claude needs a different `raw_help` directory layout (a hashed single
   directory rather than nested path tokens). Renaming alone would have left opencode with no
   union engine at all. **Consequence:** the rename was pulled forward from E into A and turned
   into a real generalization. Both behaviors are now `RULES.json` data, `claude_union` is
   deleted, and one `manifest-union` serves every agent. Equivalence was proven by regenerating
   both agents' committed unions and diffing.

2. **§5.B — the proposed registry field `maintenance.parity_acquisition = "reusable"` was not
   added.** Settled decision §8.3 already defines the gate as *enrolled in `release_watch` **and**
   carries an `acquisition` block*, and `docs/specs/agent-registry-contract.md` forbids a second
   enrollment inventory outside the registry. A new enablement field would have been exactly that
   second inventory, and could disagree with the manifest. **Consequence:** the gate is enforced
   in `manifest_acquisition::plan_for_agent`, which fails closed with a distinct error for each
   reason (`UnknownAgent`, `NotEnrolled`, `NoAcquisitionBlock`). `agent-maintenance-open-pr` uses
   a clean planner exit as the gate, so committed truth is the only source.

3. **§8.1 — "(+ `SCHEMA.json`)" mis-identified the file.** `cli_manifests/*/SCHEMA.json` is the
   normative schema for the *artifacts* (snapshots, wrapper coverage, reports); the repo has no
   JSON Schema for `RULES.json` at all. **Consequence:** the acquisition block is schema-validated
   in tested Rust (`manifest_acquisition::descriptor`) instead. That is strictly stronger than a
   JSON Schema here, because it also cross-checks the descriptor against the same file's
   `union.expected_targets` / `union.required_target` — a constraint no standalone schema could
   express.

4. **New finding — `cli_manifests/claude_code/RULES.json` carried a duplicate `scope` key.**
   A dead `"scope": "claude-code-cli-parity"` string shadowed by the real `"scope": { … }` object
   later in the same file. Every parser silently took the last one. Removed, with a parse-equality
   assertion proving the effective document is unchanged.

5. **New finding — opencode has no wrapper-coverage generator.** `codex-wrapper-coverage` and
   `claude-wrapper-coverage` are byte-identical apart from importing their own wrapper crate's
   `wrapper_coverage_manifest` module, and `crates/opencode` has no such module. **Consequence:**
   `acquisition.wrapper_coverage_command` is optional; when absent the acquire lane keeps the
   committed `wrapper_coverage.json` and says so in the log. Giving opencode a generated
   wrapper-coverage manifest is follow-on work, not part of this campaign.

6. **The three `artifacts.lock.json` files have three different schemas** (`version` +
   `upstream_repo`; `schema_version` + `upstream`; `schema_version` + `inventory`) and three
   different per-row version keys (`codex_version`, `claude_code_version`, `semantic_version`).
   **Consequence:** `acquisition.lockfile_version_key` names the row key, and the reusable lane
   rewrites only `.artifacts`, so every committed lockfile keeps the exact top-level shape it
   already has. No committed artifact is migrated to a new schema by this campaign.

## 11. Review adjudication (round 1, candidate `68f7fb27`)

Both required lanes ran in parallel against the same base/candidate. The Opus adversarial lane
returned 13 findings; each is adjudicated below. Two were already remediated by workstreams C and
E landing after the reviewed commit.

| # | Severity | Finding | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | blocker | opencode's descriptor is live but `opencode-snapshot` did not exist and its `RULES.json` lacked `sorting` | **accepted, fixed** — C added the adapter; E normalized the manifest. Also added the reviewer's suggested guard: the plan job now verifies every descriptor-named subcommand exists *before* any download, plus tests for both |
| 2 | major | `mapfile` is a bash-4 builtin; GitHub macOS runners ship bash 3.2, so every macOS target would die | **accepted, fixed** — replaced with a portable `while read` loop and an explicit array init for `set -u` |
| 3 | major | the acquisition commit is pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which does not start new workflow runs, so the packet PR's CI never sees the acquired artifacts | **accepted, fixed** — the union job now checks out with `AUTOMATION_TOKEN` |
| 4 | major | npm acquisition self-attests its own download; the retired claude lane verified against an upstream-published checksum | **accepted, fixed** — npm tarballs are now verified against `dist.integrity` (or `dist.shasum`) before the digest is written to the lockfile |
| 5 | major | `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` had no home in the acquire lane, so a self-updating CLI could invalidate its own pin mid-capture | **accepted, fixed** — new `acquisition.snapshot.env`, applied before the binary is ever executed |
| 6 | major | promotion cannot match lockfile rows written by the retired lanes, and fails opaquely | **accepted, fixed** — explicit, actionable error naming the row it wanted and telling the maintainer to re-acquire; migration noted in the workflow header |
| 7 | major | the post-matrix push has no rebase/retry, so a branch move discards ~45 minutes of work | **accepted, fixed** — bounded fetch/rebase/retry loop |
| 8 | minor | `branch_created` can be true for a branch `create-pull-request` just deleted | **accepted, fixed** — gated on `pull-request-operation` |
| 9 | minor | path-shaped descriptor fields were unvalidated; the `expand` doc comment overclaimed | **accepted, fixed** — `safe_relative_path` rejects `..`, absolute paths and backslashes; comment corrected; the unused `SCRATCH_DIR_PLACEHOLDER` removed |
| 10 | minor | both `VALIDATOR_SPEC.md` files normatively specify `OK: codex-validate` | **accepted, fixed** — specs updated to the neutral string and note the alias prints it too |
| 11 | minor | operator runbooks route maintainers to deleted workflows | **accepted, fixed** — already rewritten in the docs pass; no stale references remain under `cli_manifests/**` or `docs/**` outside frozen historical evidence |
| 12 | minor | no `SCHEMA.json` for the new block; a malformed descriptor is caught only by a command CI never runs | **accepted with reconciliation** — see §10.3 for why a JSON Schema is the wrong instrument here. The real gap was coverage, so `ci.yml` now resolves every enrolled agent's descriptor on every PR |
| 13 | nits | shell interpolation, `secrets: inherit` breadth, build-vs-reject conflation, writer/reader truncation mismatch, `install` on Windows, packument size, `support-matrix` churn | **accepted and fixed**, except `support-matrix` churn, which is intended: publication should track acquisition |

Frozen historical evidence (`docs/agents/.uaa-temp/**`, `**/governance/proof/**`, closeout JSON,
ADRs, `PLAN.md`, `ORCH_PLAN.md`) deliberately still names the retired workflows and the `codex-*`
commands. Those are records of what happened, not instructions, and the back-compat aliases keep
every command in them working.

## 12. The two stuck packets

Both are **reconcilable through the new path but not completable locally**, because completing
them requires runners this machine does not have. Neither is hand-authored.

**codex `0.144.6`** — regenerating its union through the new engine reproduces the committed
artifact exactly: 2 of 4 targets, `complete:false`, missing `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` and
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`. Those two targets need an ARM-Linux runner and a Windows runner. Running
`parity-acquire` for `codex 0.144.6` produces all four and a `complete:true` union.

**opencode `1.14.47`** — worse than partial. Its committed `union.json` was hand-produced by the
relay and carries `expected_targets` of **6** against the manifest's **3**, and its only input is
`darwin-arm64` while `required_target` is `linux-x64`. The engine refuses to build that union at
all, which is correct: `partial_union_policy.when_required_target_missing` is `fail`. There is no
local fix — the required target must actually be snapshotted. Running `parity-acquire` for
`opencode 1.14.47` regenerates the union from its own `RULES.json`, which resolves the 3-vs-6
drift as a side effect rather than by editing a committed artifact.

Deliberately **not** done: adding a validator gate asserting that a committed union's
`expected_targets` matches `RULES.json`. That check is correct and worth having, but it would make
`make preflight` red against opencode's committed union until the packet is re-acquired — i.e. it
would gate the repo on an action only the maintainer can take. It belongs in the follow-up that
lands after opencode `1.14.47` is reconciled.

## 13. Maintainer checklist (everything gated on a human)

Nothing below was performed by this session.

1. **Review and push the branch.** `feat/parity-acquisition-generalization`, branched from
   `origin/staging` @ `9400ee8e`. Nothing has been pushed.
2. **Open the PR to `staging`.**
3. **Confirm the `AUTOMATION_TOKEN` secret exists.** Finding 3 depends on it: without a PAT the
   acquisition commit will not re-trigger the packet PR's CI, and the maintainer would be
   reviewing a green check that never saw the acquired artifacts.
4. **Prove acquisition on a real runner** — the one acceptance criterion that cannot be verified
   locally, because it needs macOS/Windows/ARM runners:
   - `parity-acquire.yml` with `agent_id: codex`, `target_version: 0.144.6`, `commit: false`
   - `parity-acquire.yml` with `agent_id: claude_code`, a current stable version, `commit: false`
   Expect `complete: true` in the job summary for both.
5. **Reconcile the two stuck packets** (§12) by running `parity-acquire` with `commit: true`
   against each packet branch.
6. **Prove promotion readiness** with `parity-promote.yml`, `dry_run: true`. Do not set
   `dry_run: false` until the dry run is green and the union has been reviewed.
7. **Then, and only then, promote.** Promotion advances `latest_validated` and publishes support
   claims; it stays a human decision at every tier.

## 14. Review adjudication (Codex lane, candidate `68f7fb27`)

The Codex lane completed after the Opus lane and returned four findings, none overlapping. Its
`clippy` and `cargo test` legs could not run — its sandbox is a read-only worktree and both
failed trying to create `target/`. That verification gap is closed by the lead session's own runs
(`make preflight` green, 431 tests passing).

| # | Severity | Finding | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | blocker | `ci.yml`'s claude validation job hardcodes `asset_name: claude` and executes the downloaded blob directly; after the first acquisition through the new lane claude's rows are npm tarballs, so it matches no row and would try to run a `.tgz` | **accepted, fixed** — the job resolves its coordinates from the acquisition descriptor and extracts `archive_member`, like every other consumer |
| 2 | major | promotion builds its matrix from `union.inputs` and never consults `union.promotion_policy` | **accepted, remedy adjusted** — the proposed hard-fail on `complete != true` would contradict codex's and claude's committed `allow_promote_when_incomplete: true` linux-first policy. The fix is to make the declared policy load-bearing: promotion fails on an incomplete union unless the manifest permits it, and an agent that declares no stance (opencode) does not get one |
| 3 | major | descriptor fields are unvalidated, so a manifest edit reaches runner execution; `validation.commands` runs through `eval` | **accepted in part** — path safety landed in the previous round (`safe_relative_path`); `runs_on` is now constrained to a plain runner label. The structured-command model is **deferred**: the threat model is committed, reviewed data, and the proportionate control is review gating, so the reviewer's own `CODEOWNERS` observation was adopted instead |
| 4 | major | the packet-opener gate cannot tell "not enrolled" from "malformed descriptor", so a real regression silently opens a packet PR without the complete union | **accepted, fixed** — the planner now exits `3` for a genuine gate miss and `1` for a real failure; the workflow fails on anything else |
| — | note | no `CODEOWNERS` protects `cli_manifests/*/RULES.json` | **accepted, fixed** — added, covering the descriptors, the registry, and the four lanes they drive |

### Local end-to-end proof of the acquisition chain

The one thing that genuinely cannot be verified without CI runners is the multi-OS matrix. Every
other step of the lane was executed for real on this machine's native target
(`claude_code` / `darwin-arm64` / `2.1.219`):

1. plan resolved from `RULES.json`
2. tarball downloaded (74,831,594 bytes)
3. **verified against the registry's published `sha512` `dist.integrity`** — the finding-4 fix
4. `package/claude` extracted per `archive_member`
5. executed under the descriptor's `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` snapshot env → `2.1.219 (Claude Code)`
6. `claude-snapshot` captured 49 commands

The `opencode` chain was proven the same way end-to-end through the engines
(`opencode-snapshot` → `manifest-union` → `manifest-report` → `manifest-version-metadata`) against
the real 1.18.4 binary.

## 15. Real-runner validation (2026-07-25)

The maintainer pushed the branch, confirmed `AUTOMATION_TOKEN` exists as a repository secret, and
authorized checklist items 2–4. Two things came out of attempting them.

### 15.1 The reusable lanes are not dispatchable until they reach `main`

`workflow_dispatch` only registers if the workflow file exists on the repository's **default
branch**. This repo's default branch is `main`, not `staging`, and both new lanes exist only on the
feature branch:

```
HTTP 404: workflow parity-acquire.yml not found on the default branch
HTTP 404: workflow parity-promote.yml not found on the default branch
```

So checklist items 2 (prove acquisition on runners), 3 (reconcile the stuck packets) and 4 (prove
promotion readiness) are blocked on merge order — `feat/… → staging → main` — not on anything in
the implementation. `only-staging-to-main.yml` guards the second hop, so both merges are human.

`agent-maintenance-open-pr.yml` is on `main` and `workflow_call` has no default-branch requirement,
so dispatching *it* at the feature ref looked like a way in. It is not: its `open-pr` job checks out
`ref: staging` unconditionally, so the gate step would run `staging`'s xtask, which has no
`manifest-acquisition-plan` command, and the run would fail before reaching the acquire job.

**Decision:** merge the chain first, then run items 2–4 as real dispatches. Recorded so the next
person does not re-derive the 404.

### 15.2 A real defect the runners caught that local proof could not

`ci.yml` *is* on `main` and does carry `workflow_dispatch`, so it can be dispatched at the feature
ref — running the feature branch's own definition. Doing so failed
`Claude Code Linux (latest validated)`:

```
manifest-acquisition-plan --agent claude_code --version 2.1.29
error: cli_manifests/claude_code/artifacts.lock.json has no row for
       claude_code_version=2.1.29 target=linux-x64 asset=claude-code-linux-x64-2.1.29.tgz
```

The round-2 remedy for the Codex BLOCKER took the **asset name from the descriptor** and then
demanded a lockfile row matching it. That is the wrong authority for an already-pinned version. The
descriptor says how a *new* version would be acquired; the lockfile row records what was *actually*
pinned. They disagree across the distribution migration: `2.1.29` is pinned as a bare `claude`
binary from the old storage bucket, while the descriptor resolves an npm platform tarball. So the
job demanded a row that does not exist and failed against committed truth.

The Codex finding was correct — hardcoding `asset_name: claude` would break once acquisition writes
tarball rows — but the remedy over-corrected into assuming the post-migration shape exclusively.

**Fix** (`4ea94956`): select the row by `(version, target)` and let it name its own asset, URL,
digest and size; infer archive shape from the pinned asset name. Target, binary path and snapshot
env still come from the descriptor, since those are version-independent. The job is now correct on
both sides of the migration. Guarded by
`c4_spec_ci_pins_the_latest_validated_binary_from_the_lockfile_row_not_the_descriptor`, which fails
against the old selector.

**Why local proof missed it:** the round-2 end-to-end proof used `2.1.219`, a version that exists on
npm, so the descriptor path worked. The committed `latest_validated` is `2.1.29`, which predates the
migration. Only CI, running against committed pointers, exercised that combination.

### 15.3 Status after the fix

`ci.yml` dispatched at the feature ref: **16 jobs green**, `Publish readiness` skipped as expected.
`make preflight` locally: **exit 0**.

One process note worth keeping: an earlier local preflight was reported green when it had in fact
exited 2 on the same `fmt-check` failure CI caught. The wrapper ended with `tail`, so the captured
exit status was `tail`'s. Local and CI never actually disagreed. Propagate the real exit code.

## 16. Runner proof of items 2–4 (2026-07-25)

With both lanes on `main` they became dispatchable, and checklist items 2 and 4 are now proven on
real runners. Item 3 changed shape.

### 16.1 Item 2 — acquisition proves complete on every target

Version selection came from the tooling (`maintenance-watch`), not by hand: codex → `0.144.6`,
claude_code → `2.1.212`, opencode → `1.18.4`.

| agent | targets | union |
|---|---|---|
| codex `0.144.6` | 4/4 incl. `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `complete: true`, missing `[]` |
| claude_code `2.1.212` | 3/3 incl. `win32-x64` | `complete: true`, missing `[]` |

The two codex targets that were missing from the committed artifact are exactly the two the union
now carries, which is the acceptance criterion for the stuck-packet class.

### 16.2 A second defect only a Windows runner could find

The first claude_code run failed on `win32-x64`:

```
error: unexpected argument '--help-timeout-ms<CR>' found
  tip: a similar argument exists: '--help-timeout-ms'
```

Git Bash backs process substitution with a temp file subject to text-mode translation, so every
line read via `while read … done < <(…)` arrives with a trailing CR on the Windows runners.
`$(...)` captures use a pipe and do not. That asymmetry is why the pinned sha256 **and** the
`int()`-parsed size verified cleanly one step earlier while this loop still produced a corrupted
argument — the two facts that ruled out a blanket "jq emits CRLF" explanation.

The env loops survived only because their CR lands outside the JSON, where jq discards it as
insignificant whitespace. That is luck, not design. `parity-promote` had the same shape feeding
`eval`, so its first Windows validation leg would have failed identically.

Fixed across all 13 such reads in `parity-acquire`, `parity-promote` and `ci`, guarded by
`c4_spec_process_substitution_loops_strip_cr_for_the_windows_runners`. Re-running claude_code
`2.1.212` against the fix turned `win32-x64` green and produced `complete: true`.

Note this is the second time the *portability remedy itself* carried the next portability bug: the
bash-3.2 `mapfile` fix introduced the loop shape that then broke on Windows.

### 16.3 Item 4 — promotion readiness proven

`parity-promote` dry-run for codex `0.144.6` (committed union `complete: false`, 2/4, status
`reported`) succeeded end to end: validation ran on both union targets, then the promote job
advanced `latest_validated.txt` and the per-target pointers, copied the union to `current.json`,
set `status: validated` with its passed targets, and **passed the hard `manifest-validate` gate**.
`Open the promotion PR` was **skipped**, as dry-run requires. Nothing was self-promoted.

This exercised codex's declared `allow_promote_when_incomplete: true` (`linux_first_v1`) — the
policy path that the Codex reviewer wanted replaced with a hard fail, and which §14 kept
manifest-declared rather than assumed.

### 16.4 Item 3 — one packet is superseded, the other needs the watcher

**opencode `1.14.47` is superseded, not stuck.** Its PR **#109 is closed**; the live opencode packet
is #149 (`1.18.3`) and the watcher now targets `1.18.4`. Criterion 5 permits "completed **or
explicitly superseded**"; re-acquiring a closed packet would be wrong. Recorded as superseded.

**codex `0.144.6` (PR #153, open) cannot be reconciled by a direct `parity-acquire` dispatch.** The
branch is 13 commits behind `main` and predates the subsystem, so it carries no
`manifest_acquisition`; the plan step would invoke an xtask subcommand that branch does not have.

Chosen path: dispatch `agent-maintenance-open-pr` for codex `0.144.6`. Its `open-pr` job checks out
`staging`, regenerates the packet, and `create-pull-request` updates the existing branch — which
brings it current as a side effect — after which the `acquire` job commits the complete union. This
is the only option that proves criterion 3 end to end (watcher-opened PR → acquisition in the
runner → complete union on the branch) rather than re-proving the lane in isolation.

**Blocked on:** the CR fix reaching a ref the dispatch can use. codex's matrix includes
`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, so without it the Windows leg fails and the union comes back incomplete.

## 17. Item 3 complete — the packet reconciled end to end (2026-07-25)

`agent-maintenance-open-pr` dispatched for codex `0.144.6` ran the whole chain: packet
regeneration → acquisition gate → four-target matrix → union → report → validate → commit onto the
packet branch. PR #153 now carries:

```
adb6019c chore(codex): acquire parity artifacts for 0.144.6
214879fb chore: open maintenance packet for codex 0.144.6
```

with a committed union of `complete: true`, all four targets present, `missing: []`. Packet PR CI
on that commit: **16 jobs green**. `status` remains `reported` — promotion is still a separate,
maintainer-triggered decision.

This is criterion 3 satisfied in the form it was written: a watcher-opened packet PR landing a
complete multi-target union, acquisition run in the runner. Retrofitting the branch by hand would
have proven the lane but not the wiring.

It also confirmed Opus finding 3's fix in production: the acquisition push **re-triggered CI on
#153** (`adb6019c pull_request CI`). Under `GITHUB_TOKEN` it silently would not have, and a
maintainer would have been reviewing a green check that never saw the acquired artifacts.

### 17.1 A third defect, found only by committing

The first attempt failed at the last step of an otherwise perfect run:

```
fatal: pathspec 'docs/support' did not match any files
```

`docs/support` is not a path this repository has. `git add` fails the whole commit on a pathspec
that matches nothing, so four downloads, four snapshots, the union, the report and the version
metadata were all discarded after the matrix had already succeeded. The real publication paths are
`support_matrix::JSON_OUTPUT_PATH` and `MARKDOWN_OUTPUT_PATH`.

Fixed and bound to those constants by
`c4_spec_acquisition_commits_the_paths_support_matrix_actually_publishes`, so renaming either fails
in CI rather than at the end of an hour-long matrix. Every other path in that `git add` list was
verified against all three agents.

Only a `commit: true` run could surface it — every `commit: false` proof skips the step entirely.

### 17.2 Standing gap: workflow changes get no multi-OS coverage

All 17 `ci.yml` jobs are `ubuntu-latest`, and `parity-acquire`/`parity-promote` carry only
`workflow_call` and `workflow_dispatch` — no `pull_request` trigger. A PR that edits these lanes
therefore gets **zero** macOS or Windows coverage; PR #156's green checks never ran a Windows job.

Three of the defects in this campaign were platform- or execution-mode-specific (`mapfile` on bash
3.2, CR from Git Bash process substitution, `git add` on a `commit: true` path) and none were
reachable from a `commit: false` Linux run. The static guards added here cover those specific
shapes cheaply; a paths-filtered multi-OS job on `.github/workflows/**` would cover the class.
Left as a maintainer decision because it changes CI cost and required-check configuration.

**Decided 2026-09-13: deferred.** The static contract tests in `c4_spec_ci_wiring.rs` remain the only
guard on workflow changes; revisit after T3.

## 18. T1 complete — the audit gate, and what it cost to trust it (2026-07-25)

`maintenance-audit-status` landed across five implementation rounds and four review rounds
(`b1aec687`, `59f581ce`, `d41bb279`, `4620b531`, `b55cef4f`). Every review round found real
defects, and the last one found the worst.

### 18.1 The defect that nearly shipped

Round 4 bound every `coverage.*.json` in a version directory to the target version, on the premise
that this proved the acquisition evidence was sound. It did not. It proved only that no file came
from a *different* version.

`manifest_report` never writes a report for a target it did not acquire. So an acquisition that
lost two of four legs emits `coverage.any.json` plus the legs that succeeded — every one carrying
the correct `inputs.upstream.semantic_version`. All of them passed. The union's deltas were
computed over acquired targets only, so `required_uplifts_this_run` came back empty and the gate
returned **exit 0** for an acquisition that never inspected macOS or Windows.

This was not hypothetical. Five of the seven committed codex acquisitions are that shape
(`complete: false`, one input, two missing targets), and `parity-acquire` was believed to continue
on a partial matrix: `fail-fast: false`, only `REQUIRED_TARGET` enforced, every other missing leg a
`::warning`. Reproduced on real 0.144.6 data by deleting the darwin and windows reports and flipping
`union.json` — the gate returned exit 0 and `uplifts_required: false`.

*Correction (2026-09-13):* the partial-matrix belief was wrong for a leg that fails. `union` has
`needs: [plan, snapshot]` with no status-function `if:`, so a failed leg skips `union` entirely;
`complete: false` is written only when a leg succeeds but its snapshot artifact never arrives. The
defect above is still real for committed history and local runs. See §18.5 and `uaa-0030`.

The fix reads the completeness the acquisition already records in
`snapshots/<version>/union.json` and refuses anything short of `complete=true`, naming the missing
targets. Evidence validation also ran only on the clean path, so an exit-3 relay packet could be
derived from evidence belonging to another version; it now runs unconditionally, ahead of
derivation.

This is the same root cause as the standing gap in §17.2. Incomplete multi-OS acquisition was not
merely unenforced in CI — it was *invisible* to the governance gate built to catch it.

### 18.2 Why the parallel review lanes earned their cost

The lead's own verification passed at every round, because it kept asking whether each round did
what it intended rather than whether the intent was sufficient. The Codex lane raised a narrower
version of the same area (stale sibling *content*) that was adjudicated as a deferred limitation.
The adversarial lane attacked the premise instead and found that version binding never proved
completeness at all. T1 would have been declared done before round 4 ran, and T2 and T3 would have
been built on a gate that could not see the thing it existed to catch.

### 18.3 Known debt carried out of T1

Recorded in `docs/backlog.json` as the canonical follow-up register. Do not re-derive these from
scratch; each entry carries its own context, file list and deliverables.

| id | item | why deferred |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uaa-0023` | Typed errors for support-audit evidence faults | Round 5 classifies some faults by matching error message text, because the packet scoped `support_audit.rs` out of the write set. Failure direction is safe — a message drift yields exit 1, never a false clean — so it is fragility, not a correctness hole. |
| `uaa-0024` | Union-vs-per-target coverage coherence contract | Requires first defining what coherence means between the union and its inputs; that contract does not exist yet. Design task, not a bug fix. |
| `uaa-0025` | Projection cannot detect same-request staleness | `request_sha256` cannot detect the one staleness case it was added for, since a re-run of the same request produces the same hash. Best resolved with T2, which defines how the workflow consumes the projection. |
| `uaa-0026` | Exit 3 lost when `--emit-json` cannot be written | Pre-existing, not introduced by T1. The computed outcome is discarded by a `?` on the write path. Needs an explicit precedence decision, coordinated with T2's exit-code routing. |

Status as of 2026-09-13: `uaa-0026` is **done** (`72191bb3`, the computed outcome takes
precedence). `uaa-0025` was marked closed during T2a, disproved by the T2 adversarial lane, and is
**reopened** with a wider scope (§18.5).

### 18.4 What T2 inherits

The gate now has three outcomes to route, not two: clean (0), uplifts required (3), and
insufficient evidence — which includes "the matrix ran but did not finish". T2a later split that
case out as exit **4**, so CI routes it by number; other evidence failures stay exit 2.

As written on 2026-07-25, this section said a flaked macOS or Windows leg would land on the
incomplete-acquisition exit because `parity-acquire` continues on a partial matrix by design. That
premise was wrong (§18.1 correction): a failed leg skips `union`, so the gate never runs. The
maintainer's policy — retry missing legs once, then fail — was implemented in T2b as a step-level
retry-once inside each snapshot leg, because Actions cannot re-run individual matrix legs.

### 18.5 Debt recorded while T2 is open (2026-09-13)

T2 is code-complete at `24a95b52` (T2a `72191bb3`, T2b `e87a9a1d`, T2c `24a95b52`), but its last
fix round has not been reviewed, so it has no section of its own yet; §19 is written when T2
closes. These items are recorded now so they are not lost. Each is in `docs/backlog.json`, and the
spec's §8.1 carries the same table.

| id | item | source | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uaa-0025` | Projection can survive a failed run as a stale result | T2 adversarial M3 (probe-proven), Codex F3 and F4, adversarial L9 | Reopened. The request load derives internally, so later request-validation failures are classified preflight and leave a stale projection behind exit 2. Resolve with or before T3. |
| `uaa-0027` | Snapshot retry can mix two attempts in raw_help | T2 adversarial L7 | Low; raw_help is never committed. |
| `uaa-0028` | `--emit-json` cleanup has no ownership guard | T2 adversarial L8 (suspected) | Low until T3 makes the projection path durable. |
| `uaa-0029` | No `on.workflow_call.outputs` for the gate verdict | handoff reading (H1), unreviewed | T3 prerequisite. |
| `uaa-0030` | One failed leg skips `union`, gate, commit and upload | handoff reading (H2); confirmed in T2c review | Decided 2026-09-13: preserve completed legs, except a failed required target, which still hard-fails with no union. **Resolved in `a3c8ce53`** (§19). |
| `uaa-0031` | Blocking verdict not visible on the packet PR | handoff reading (H3); confirmed by reading in T2c review; Opus F2; confirmed on a runner 2026-09-14 (see §19.3) | T3 design input. T3 also renders the exit-3 `required_uplifts` detail that `_ci_tmp` cleanup deletes today. |
| `uaa-0032` | Version mismatch fails dry runs and promote-prerequisite re-runs | handoff reading (H5); confirmed in T2c review | Decided 2026-09-13: fail only when committing; a dry-run mismatch emits a notice. The mismatch is checked before the validated load and gets exit 5. Promote-prerequisite re-runs with `commit: true` are accepted as red-but-committed. **Resolved in `a3c8ce53` / `916c9e9b`** (§19). |
| `uaa-0033` | Artifact bundle does not match what the run committed | T2c review (Opus, suspected; Codex) | Low. |
| `uaa-0034` | Commit step can push a rebased tree the gate never judged | T2c review (Opus, suspected) | Low; pre-dates T2c. |

## 19. T2 complete — wiring the gate into `parity-acquire` (2026-09-13)

T2 landed across five commits: T2a `72191bb3`, T2b `e87a9a1d`, T2c `24a95b52`, T2d `a3c8ce53`,
T2e `916c9e9b`. The `Maintenance audit gate` step in the `union` job runs
`maintenance-audit-status --expect-target-version "$VERSION"`, records a verdict instead of failing,
and a terminal step fails the job only after commit and the `always()` artifact upload.

Final exit routing in the gate:

| exit | meaning | recorded verdict | job |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | clean | `closeout_ready=true` | green |
| 3 | uplifts required | `uplifts_required=true`, placeholder relay line (T3 renders the real one) | green, still commits |
| 4 | union incomplete | blocking | fails after commit and upload |
| 5 | request describes another version | blocking only when `commit: true`; a dry run gets a `::notice` | red only when committing |
| 2, 1, other; missing request | validation / internal | blocking | fails after commit and upload |

`union` now runs whenever the run was not cancelled and `plan` succeeded, so a failed non-required
leg yields an incomplete union that is gated, committed and uploaded before the job fails. A failed
required target still hard-fails with no union, because `manifest-union` cannot build one.

### 19.1 What the review rounds found

Four review rounds ran on T2, each with a Codex lane and an Opus adversarial lane in parallel, and
every round found real defects.

- **T2b review** — two blocking premise errors: the gate checked the request's version, never the
  version the run acquired; and a failing gate step skipped the commit, discarding an hour of matrix
  work. T2c fixed both.
- **T2c review (2026-09-13)** — the contract tests bound spelling, not behaviour. Recording exit 4 as
  code `0`, writing `audit_failed=false` literally, or a `kill $$` in the uplift branch all left
  16/16 green, and one of them turns every blocking verdict green. The version mismatch was checked
  after the request loader's own live derivation, so malformed evidence for the request's version
  hid it, and as a plain exit 2 it could not be downgraded on a dry run without downgrading real
  failures. Both lanes also confirmed H1, H2, H5 and, by reading, H3, and showed the maintainer's
  H2 rule could not cover a failed required target.
- **T2d re-review** — the new harness still supplied the `COMMIT` env it should have been checking
  (deleting the binding stayed green while the real step would die on an unbound variable and skip
  the commit); the delimiter and annotation assertions each ruled out only one example; the script
  extractor could silently truncate a step; and the pre-check missed inline-table requests.

The pattern from T1 held: each defect was a check aimed at the wrong thing. The lead's own
verification passed at every round, including one mutation check that silently tested nothing
because a `sed` pattern did not match — caught only because the mutation count was printed.

### 19.2 Operational note

The Codex lane first ran on the `atomize_systems_azure` profile, whose Azure endpoint no longer
resolves; `codex exec` retried "waiting for network" for 32 minutes without a timeout. Codex lanes
now run as plain `codex exec` on the maintainer's ChatGPT auth, wrapped in `timeout`. After T2 closed,
the launchers (`scripts/run-codex-worker.sh`, `.ps1`) and agent definitions stopped requiring a
profile and gained a default 3600-second timeout. Agent `isolation: worktree` also starts from the remote default branch, so reviews of
local-only commits need a lead-created `git worktree add --detach`.

### 19.3 Debt carried out of T2

Recorded in `docs/backlog.json`; the spec's §8.1 carries the same table.

| id | item | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uaa-0025` | Projection can survive a failed run as a stale result | Resolve with or before T3, the first consumer. |
| `uaa-0027` | Snapshot retry can mix two attempts in raw_help | Low. |
| `uaa-0028` | `--emit-json` cleanup has no ownership guard | Low until T3 makes the path durable. |
| `uaa-0029` | No `on.workflow_call.outputs` | T3 prerequisite. |
| `uaa-0031` | Verdict not visible on the packet PR; exit-3 uplift detail deleted with `_ci_tmp` | T3 design input. Confirmed on a runner 2026-09-14: acquire checks attach to the `staging` head, not the packet PR. |
| `uaa-0033` | Artifact bundle does not match what the run committed | Low. |
| `uaa-0034` | Commit step can push a rebased tree the gate never judged | Low; pre-dates T2. |

Resolved during T2: `uaa-0026` (`72191bb3`), `uaa-0030` (`a3c8ce53`), `uaa-0032` (`a3c8ce53`,
`916c9e9b`).

Nothing from T2 has run on a real runner. The watcher dispatches from `staging`, so the first
nightly `agent-maintenance-open-pr` run after T2 merges there is the proof; no manual dispatch is
needed. The H3 question in `uaa-0031` did not have to wait for it: the 2026-09-13 watcher runs
(pre-T2) already show the acquire check runs attached to `staging`'s head commit `a36a115d`, while
packet PRs #195, #205 and #206 carry only `CI` checks.

## 20. Pre-merge simulation of the gate (2026-09-14)

Before asking for the T2 merge, the lead ran this branch's `maintenance-audit-status` exactly as the
`union` job does, against each open packet branch's committed request and acquisition artifacts
(`staging` + packet commit + acquisition commit, the tree the first post-merge nightly run judges).
Request generation (`prepare.rs`) is unchanged since `staging`, so the packet requests match what
merged code would write.

| packet | before the fixes | after `66f7b30c` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| codex 0.153.4 (#206) | exit 3, 38 uplifts | exit 3, 38 uplifts, projection bytes identical |
| claude_code 2.1.236 (#195) | exit 3, 117 uplifts | exit 3, 117 uplifts, projection bytes identical |
| opencode 1.18.29 (#205) | exit 1, "support-audit command row must not use an empty path" | exit 3, 494 uplifts including the root command |

Two pre-existing defects in the shared support-audit derivation, not in the gate, blocked opencode.
Both would also have blocked packet opening and closeout validation for that version:

1. **Root command row.** opencode's wrapper coverage declares only `run`, so its 1.18.29 report lists
   the root command (`path: []`) as missing. The mapper assumed every command row has a last path
   element. `507cf300` names it `commands` / `<agent_id>` / `<agent_id>` (maintainer-approved), keeps
   it a required uplift, and checks each row's shape against its report list so a malformed flag row
   cannot become a root command.
2. **Omitted optional list.** The report writer omits `deltas.intentionally_unsupported` when it is
   empty; the audit required it. codex and claude_code passed only because each report carries two
   such rows. `66f7b30c` reads an absent list as empty (maintainer-approved relaxation); the other
   three lists stay required.

A ChatGPT Pro consult (advisory; `.codex/guidance/2026-09-14-opencode-root-command-audit.md`,
gitignored) agreed with fixing before merge and with the tuple, and added the row-shape boundary.

### 20.1 Review round

Both lanes reviewed `79b305e2..66f7b30c`. The Codex lane now runs through the fixed launcher with no
profile. The Opus lane returned CLEAN with three low observations; the Codex lane returned two
findings. Both lanes scanned every committed coverage report reachable from `staging` and the three
packet refs, and compared old and new derivation for every committed request (the Opus lane with
binaries built at both revisions; the Codex lane with an in-memory replica, because its sandbox
blocked `cargo`). No evidence is newly rejected, no identity is lost, and the only derivation or
closeout-outcome change is opencode 1.18.29.

| finding | verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Codex 1: uaa-0035 claimed a root-command exclusion would keep the 20 root flags; `manifest_report` `continue`s past an excluded command's flags and arguments | **accepted, fixed** in uaa-0035, spec §8.1, and the debt inventory note. The lead had repeated the same wrong claim to the maintainer |
| Codex 2: the contract said every surface row comes from a report row; without a report it falls back to debt rows | **accepted, fixed** |
| Codex note: malformed-row classification was asserted by substring, not through the classifier | **accepted, fixed**: tests call `is_bad_support_audit_evidence_message` |
| Opus O1: claude_code debt rows use `claude install`, report-derived surfaces use `claude_code install`, so they never match (pre-existing) | **accepted, deferred** as `uaa-0036`, a maintainer decision; pointer in spec T8 and the debt inventory |
| Opus O2: contract wording omitted `path` array rules and the optional list | **accepted, fixed** |
| Opus O3: some xtask suites failed when two test runs overlapped in its scratch copy | **no action**: environment only; they pass run alone and in the lead's `make preflight` |
| Lead: the new unit tests compiled into all five integration crates that include `support_audit.rs` by path, so they ran six times | **fixed**: the test module moved under `agent_maintenance/mod.rs`, which only the lib compiles |

A follow-up round on the remediation delta (`66f7b30c..1121df69`) came back CLEAN from the Opus
lane, with two docs notes: the Opus observation count and a missing pointer-removal step in
uaa-0036. The Codex lane showed the contract fix for Codex 2 was still incomplete: when a report
exists, debt rows that match no gap surface become `removed_upstream_surface` rows with the debt
row's own identity. That also means uaa-0036's claude_code rows appear as removed surface, which
contract field invariant 6 ties to publication contraction. All three were fixed in the contract,
uaa-0036, and this section.

A final confirmation round on `1121df69..081c9a95` agreed from both lanes: the contract paragraph
had no false statement but did not say that shared code always leaves
`eligible_preexisting_surface` empty, and the spec §8.1 row for uaa-0036 named only the T8 pointer.
Both were fixed in the next commit. The plan's §20.2 table keeps §8.1 out of the trigger points,
because it is a tracking table rather than a place the decision is hit.

### 20.2 Open decisions and where they are triggered

The maintainer asked that deferred decisions sit where they will be hit, not only in the backlog.
Neither relies on closeout validation to force it.

| id | decision | trigger points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uaa-0035` | Is opencode's TUI root command (with its root flags and `project` argument) excluded from parity? | spec T5 and T8 open-decisions list; debt inventory "Open decisions" |
| `uaa-0036` | Is `command_path` rooted at the agent id or the binary name? | spec T8 open-decisions list; debt inventory "Open decisions"; contract "Known conflict" note |
